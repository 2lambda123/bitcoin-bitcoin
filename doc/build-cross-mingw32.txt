MinGW32 cross-compilation instructions

written by Denis Roio <jaromil@dyne.org>
testing contributed by Matt Corallo <matt@bluematt.me>


Install mingw32 (packages found in Debian, Ubuntu, Fedora and others)

Cross-compile all needed libraries and run:

./configure --host=i586-mingw32msvc \
	    --with-boost-libdir=bitcoin-mingw32-libs/lib \
	    --with-boost=bitcoin-mingw32-libs

Where one should substitute 'bitcoin-mingw32-libs' with the path to
the libraries that were compiled.

Please note both --with-boost flags are needed

If all goes well with the configure detection then you can run

make

which should produce bitcoin (if WX GUI was selected) 
and bitcoind (background daemon)
