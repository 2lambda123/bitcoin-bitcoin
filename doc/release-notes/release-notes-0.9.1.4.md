How to Upgrade
--------------

If you are running an older version, shut it down. Wait until it has completely
shut down (which might take a few minutes for older versions), then run the
installer (on Windows) or just copy over /Applications/Credits-Qt (on Mac) or
creditsd/credits-qt (on Linux).

0.9.1.4 Release notes
=======================

0.9.1.4 is the initial release of the Bitcredit client and server software. 
The version follows the Bitcoin versions to be able to tell, at a glance, which 
version of the Bitcoin client that runs internally. The first three digits tracks
Bitcoin client version, the fourth is an independent version of Bitcredit. 
The independent version is reset every time the Bitcoin tracking version changes.
