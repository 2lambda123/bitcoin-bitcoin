# Hub
Hub is a dataset of blockheaders for Bitcoin. 
The dataset is divided in eight files, with each file including approximately 100,000 blocks.
The data included in the dataset includes: id, nonce, hash, merkle_root, time, version, and bits.
This dataset was aggregated and consolidated from block data available via the [Bitcoin Forum](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5246271.0).
The dataset has been cleaned and pre-processed for the purpose making academic research easier and more accessible.
