https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bilderberg_Group#Criticism

    Partly because of its working methods to ensure strict privacy, the Bilderberg Group has been criticised for its lack of transparency and accountability.

    Due to its privacy, Bilderberg has been accused of conspiracies.

    This outlook has been popular on both extremes of the political spectrum, even if they disagree about the exact nature of the group's intentions.

    Some on the left accuse the Bilderberg group of conspiring to impose capitalist domination, while some on the right have accused the group of conspiring to impose a world government and planned economy.
