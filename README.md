What is MicroBitcoin?
----------------

MicroBitcoin is an experimental digital currency forked from [Bitcoin](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin) that enables instant payments to
anyone, anywhere in the world. MicroBitcoin uses peer-to-peer technology to operate
with no central authority: managing transactions and issuing money are carried
out collectively by the network. MicroBitcoin is the name of open source
software which enables the use of this currency.

For more information, as well as an immediately useable, binary version of
the MicroBitcoin software, see https://microbitcoin.org, or read the
[whitepaper](https://microbitcoin.org/assets/MBC_Whitepaper_v1.pdf).
