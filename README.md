Statoshi: Bitcoin Core + statistics logging
=====================================

[![Live Dashboard at statoshi.info](http://statoshi.info)]

What is Statoshi?
----------------

Statoshi's objective is to protect Bitcoin by bringing transparency to the activity 
occurring on the node network. By making this data available, Bitcoin developers can 
learn more about node performance, gain operational insight about the network, and 
the community can be informed about attacks and aberrant behavior in a timely fashion.

Installation & Configuration
-------------------

Installation instructions can be found [here](https://jlopp.github.io/statoshi/).

A system metrics daemon is available [here](https://github.com/jlopp/bitcoin-utils/blob/master/systemMetricsDaemon.py)

Statoshi also supports running multiple nodes that emit metrics to a single graphite instance. 
In order to facilitate this, you can add a line to bitcoin.conf that will partition each 
metric by the name of the host: statshostname=yourNodeName

If you're running a fleet of nodes and you want to deduplicate peer connections between them, 
there is a [PHP daemon](https://github.com/jlopp/bitcoin-utils/tree/master/node_connection_manager) 
currently under development for this purpose.
