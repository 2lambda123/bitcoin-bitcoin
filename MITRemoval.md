# The Official Removal of the MIT License as Permitted by the MIT License:

```
proof:
Public Government Licenses are defined as permission, agreement, and permit.
Private Licenses are defined as a contract between two parties over the rights of use.

Licensing agreements between private parties involve one party allowing another to use, create or sell its products or intellectual property.

A licensing agreement is a contract that allows one party (the licensee) to use and/or earn revenue from the property of the owner (the licensor).

Licensing agreements are legal contracts that are written between two parties.

Software agreements and Licenses are legally defined as contractual obligations.

A licensing agreement is a contract between two parties.

Reports of Cases Determined in the Supreme Court: Volume 168
Licenseâ€”Contract for the purpose of carrying out tasks with private property which would otherwise be illegal to perform.
```

##The Call for Responsibility of Humans by Finally Working Together Worldwide:
Since the Supreme Court Defined License as a Contract; it has created a world of hurt for the open-source community. Google, Apple, MS, Amazon, and all of the big corporations are submitting for hundreds of thousands of patents, and they consist overwhelmingly of open source/non-patentable works. While software is not restricted to anyone with this license, so crypto shall not be hindered, it will restrict universities from stealing their students' inventions and patenting them. It allows for the original authors to have three years of exclusive publishing rights for their research verbatim. Since this project is old, that time has expired. The original claim of authorship/ownership shall remain with the same people/teams as before. Those with malicious intent could have taken over the entire crypto market legally. That option is too late now as the fork of this software has spread to every MIT license and nullified while replacing it with the Public Resource License. The MIT licenses must be updated and replaced with this license as it has legal claim and authority to protect all MIT content. The claim of authorship remains with the discoverers, and authors: https://github.com/PublicResourceLicense/PublicResourceLicense/blob/main/prl%20license.txt

This repository is now sublicensed under the **Public Resource License:**

Focus attention on the bolded wording.

## First Phase \| Legal Documentations of the License:

A software license agreement is a legal document that stipulates key conditions.

*Licenses, contracts, end-user agreements, general agreements, software technical documents, entitlements, and any other written document* that does not execute as code are all examples of documentation, according to legal definition.

Therefore, I hereby redefine the master MIT-license to:

# Second Phase \| NEW MIT LICENSE

###### `________________Master MIT License:`

`The MIT License (MIT)`
`Copyright (c) 2022 Public Resource License`

**`Permission is hereby granted`**`solely to the Organizers of the Public Resource`

`THE SOFTWARE.`

###### `________________Master MIT License:`

The version above now applies to every MIT licensed software in existence effective 02/12/2022.

## **Third Phase:**

This license is not legal within the court system. You cannot have only one party in the agreement forfeit rights while the other party has no liability even if intentional. A license is equal to a contract according to the U.S. Supreme Court; and for a contract to be valid, it must have consideration of both parties. This license does not offer consideration of any sort. This license, if challenged by the legal system would fail since it touches the lines of slavery by legal contract which has been downright outlawed.

Since neither would be considered valid. I now call upon the Logical Method's Public Resource License for GitResearch.org.

I shall use my authority as vested to me through the use of a single license which governs all pieces every copy of this license and I apply the defined licensed from the second phase as a temporary placeholder.

## **Final Phase: The Voidance of Every MIT License and Replacement.**

To ensure that these works remain public. I hereby use the authority given to me to remove and replace this license.

Please update the repositories of all humans so that we can focus on what makes a different instead of fighting with each other in present.

The license grants this authority to any person by these statements:
**Permission is hereby granted to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the "Software")**, **to deal in the Software without restriction without limitation the right to modify the Software.**

Notice: software is first defined with a lowercase s, this is to denote the software only. When the "Software" is defined, it includes both the software and documentation which gives anyone ultimate control of every MIT license.

I hereby add to the MASTER MIT LICENSE which replaces all MIT licenses worldwide as it is grants anyone power without limitation to do so:

"The MIT license is sublicensed by the Public Resource License available at GitResearch.org/license and GitHub.com/PublicResourceLicense
/PublicResourceLicense.

The Public Resource License shall not change drastically nor fundamentally. Only further definitions may be added, along with some minor clarifications. The final version of this license may not exceed Feb. 22nd, 2022.

Should the MIT license be excluded, fail, become void, or replaced as a license in any scenario for any reason; then the Public Resource License as describe shall supersede and all existing content licensed under MIT LICENSE will now be licensed under the Public Resource License. The content will therefore be licensed solely under the Public Resource License, and the remainder of this file and license shall be completely void which only the Public Resource License shall remain to govern and define the usage humans may have for research humans have completed."

I hereby void (4:44AM CST on 2/12/2022) every MIT license in existence minus the line in quotes above. The new license for this repository shall supersede all others if licensed by the MIT LICENSE at the moment of 4:44AM CST on 2/12/2022.
