   (Gadolinium Gallium Garnet Quantum Electronic Processors) a.k.a.  [GGGQEP]You only need three lasers to write the data and one to read.  It's the same technology as 3D glass etching. If you double its size to  10cm^3, then you have 8 times the storage, and even if you are not  atomically precise, you could hold two internets. It's the same  technology as 3D glass etching. The following is a theoretical data (zdroje jsou)  storage method that untilizes a sythetic crystal called "GGG" or  "Gadolinium Gallium Garnet". It is manufactured as a diamond sythetic,  and is derived from "Gadolinium Gallium Oxide". These are transparent  crystaline solids with a high hardness and density. With 3 powerful  lasers, you burn out a point within the crystal, and with a scanning  device to read data from it. You can only read and write; you cannot  delete or rewrite the data.

Google processes 8 exabytes of data every year. As of March  2010, the global monthly Internet traffic is estimated to be 21  exabytes. As of May 2009, the size of the World's total Digital content  has been roughly estimated to be 500 billion gigabytes, or 5000 exabytes.
