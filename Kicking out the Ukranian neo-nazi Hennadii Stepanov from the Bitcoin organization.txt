Hennadii Stepanov, aka @hebasto, is a phony identity created by the Ukrainian neo-nazi Azov battalion in collaboration with Ukraine's Ministry of Digital Transformation.

Ukraine's so-called Ministry of Digital Transformation, recently defrauded the Bitcoin community out of over $100 million dollars, which was spent on luxury cars and bulletproof vests. Since when is the Bitcoin community obligated to provide food and water to those who gang rape underage girls and behead, bomb, stab, torture, burning alive people who speak Russian? I can post videos and photos of brutal stabbings, torture, and even the deployment of disabled people to the front lines against Russia.

Let me ask you, @hebasto aka Hennadii Stepanov, why you aren't on the front lines to begin with. Is it mandatory for all Ukrainian men to take up arms and enlist! Of course, you are not present because you work for Ukraine's Ministry of Digital Transformation.

I demand that we discuss this right away on the repository. The so-called "Bitcoin organization," which only exists on GitHub, is entirely made up of un-elected members who are solely from NATO and the Five Eyes alliance.

This guy is a complete fraud, so as all other Ukranian, an neo-nazi scammers who fundraising for murdering, bombing and gang raping, burning people alive. Hennadii Stepanov @hebasto has no place in Bitcoin, in fact the entire "Bitcoin organization" on GitHub is a big fraud run by a Dutch @MarcoFalke and an Australian @fanquake whom are happily merging commits from the French National Cybersecurity Agency ANSSI (French Ministry of Defense) as it happened with taproot.

Not to mention that FTX is partnered with the Ministry of Digital Transformation of Ukraine.

We all had enough from Ukraine, Ukrainian and NATO propaganda, as well from this fake "Bitcoin organization".
